### Recommended Search Sources

#### Full-text search engines
- **[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)** — thousands of public-domain novels fully searchable. Use the search form or download `.txt` files and grep for time phrases.
- **[Internet Archive — Open Library](https://archive.org/details/texts)** — scanned books with OCR text. Search for time strings like `"quarter past two"`.
- **[HathiTrust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/)** — full-text search across millions of digitised books (requires free account for snippet view).

#### Quotation databases
- **[The Guardian Literary Clock](https://www.theguardian.com/books/table/2011/apr/21/literary-clock)** — the original crowdsourced list that inspired this project; scan for times not yet in the dataset.
- **[Goodreads Quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes)** — search for time-related phrases (e.g. `"quarter past three"`).
- **[Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/)** — per-author quote pages; scan dialogue-heavy works.

#### Genre-specific recommendations
Many of the missing times fall in the awkward "odd minutes" range (e.g. `14:37`, `21:43`). Precise times like these appear most often in:

| Genre / Style | Why | Example authors |
|---|---|---|
| Crime & detective fiction | Characters track exact times as evidence | Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, P.D. James |
| War & military fiction | Military time (`0347h`, `14:52`) is used precisely | Ernest Hemingway, Sebastian Faulks, Pat Barker |
| Science fiction | Clocks, countdowns, ship logs | Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Arthur C. Clarke |
| Journalism / non-fiction narrative | Timestamped reconstructions | Truman Capote (*In Cold Blood*), Erik Larson |
| Diaries & epistolary novels | Dated entries with exact times | Samuel Pepys, Anne Frank, Bram Stoker (*Dracula*) |
| Spy fiction | Mission schedules | John le Carré, Ian Fleming |

### How to Add a New Quote

1. Find a passage containing a clearly stated time that matches one of the missing timecodes above.
2. Add a new entry directly to `docs/litclock.json`.

**JSON entry format** (the `label` must be an exact substring of `quote`):

```json
{
  "timecode": "14:37",
  "label": "twenty-three to three",
  "quote": "The little clock on the mantelpiece had its hands set at twenty-three to three.",
  "book": "Example Novel",
  "author": "A. N. Author"
}
```

Key rules:
- `timecode` must use `H:MM` format (no leading zero on the hour).
- `label` must be a verbatim lowercase substring of `quote`.
- `quote` should be a complete sentence or self-contained passage — avoid fragments that lose their meaning out of context.
- Prefer public-domain works or quotes short enough to qualify as fair use.

## Progress Tracking

As gaps are filled, update the table in the **Coverage by Hour** section and remove the resolved timecodes from the missing-times lists above. Open a pull request for each batch of additions so changes can be reviewed.
